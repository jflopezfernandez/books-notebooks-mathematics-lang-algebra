\begin{exercise}
	Show that every group of order $\leqq 5$ is abelian.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proposition}
	Every group of order less than or equal to five is abelian.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	The group of order one is simply the trivial group consisting of the identity element alone. Since the identity element is nilpotent under the group operation, the group is abelian. The groups of order $2$, $3$, and $5$ are of prime order, and every group of prime order is abelian.
	\newline\newline
	By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, every abelian group of finite order is either cyclic (and thus abelian) or the external direct product of cyclic groups of prime-power order.
\end{proof}
